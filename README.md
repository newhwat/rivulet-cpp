# Rivulet Lang (CPP Compiler)

This is a hobby programming language, named after a small river or stream since it is lightweight and simple. ðŸ’§

The compiler will be written entirely in C++. Development through CMake.

## Building on your system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newhwat/rivulet-cpp.git
cd rivulet-cpp

cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
